"program": "Several years ago our organization purchased a good quality dog costume, with the intention of having a Humane Society Mascot.  Our local newspaper sponsored a \"name the mascot\" contest, and \"Hero\" was the winning entry.  Since then, Hero has made numerous appearances at community events, schools, nursing homes, etc, promoting the Humane Society and our programs.  Although the initial expenditure was high, we feel that Hero has paid for himself many times over, with the goodwill he promotes toward our organization.  Occasionally we have to spend a little money to get Hero's costume cleaned, and purchase supplies to keep him \"cool\" during the hot summer appearances."
